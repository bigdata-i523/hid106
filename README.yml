        Recently, people tend to use auto play-next while using a cloud-based music app. 
        In this case, content recommendation is at the heart of most subscription-based 
        media stream platforms. A good recommendation system based on a huge number of 
        historical records and metadata can vastly enhance user experience and increase
        user engagement. In our project, we would build machine learning models to predict 
        what songs are going to be listened next week. The training data would be a copy
        of user listening history during a month period and predict what songs a set of 
        predetermined users would listen to during the next week.
